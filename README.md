# Reducing Toil

It may be possible for some of the redundant notices to be filtered in the current system, as well as auto-assingment of issues based on their type. 

For example, EnpointRegistration issuses could be auto-assigned to the endpoint team, with LLMModel issues being assigned to the LLM team.
